## Linux groups and docker access
> Every file, process, or resource has ownership
> A group is a named collection of users
> Permissions can be set for the owner or the group
> Docker runs a daemon (dockerd) in the background that listens on a Unix socket
> By default, only root (linux) can access this socket
> The docker group is a special Linux group whose members are allowed to talk to the Docker daemon without being root.
> Command:
	sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
		> usermod modifies user accounts.
		> -aG docker means: append the user to the group docker.
		> $USER is your current username.
	newgrp docker
		> newgrp starts a new shell with a different primary group.

## docker-compose.yml Redis
> Redis stores its persistent data (like cached sessions or database snapshots) in /data. 
> By mounting a volume, the data survives even if the container is stopped or deleted.
> File:
	volumes:
		  - redis-data:/data 			# Mount a volume named redis-data to the path /data INSIDE the Redis container

	# Volume Declaration/Configuration for Data Persistence
	volumes:
	  redis-data:							# On Docker host (OUTSIDE)
		driver: local

/data						Inside container		Redis writes here                      
redis-data volume  On Docker host		Persists data across container restarts

## Create a local branch from the remote
git checkout -b chunks-retrieval origin/feat/chunks-retrieval
	> -b chunks-retrieval → creates a new local branch called chunks-retrieval.
	> origin/feat/chunks-retrieval → sets it to start at the remote branch.
After this, your local branch tracks the remote branch automatically, so git pull will work without extra flags.

## What is Uvicorn 
> is a lightweight, fast, asynchronous web server for Python, primarily used to serve ASGI applications. 
> Uvicorn supports ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), which is a modern standard for Python web apps.
> ASGI allows handling asynchronous code, WebSockets, and long-lived connections, which WSGI (the older standard used by Flask/Django) cannot do easily.
Use Cases:
> Serving FastAPI, Starlette, or Django Channels applications.
> Handling APIs, WebSockets, background tasks, and high-throughput async endpoints.

Think of Uvicorn as the engine and your FastAPI app as the car body.
